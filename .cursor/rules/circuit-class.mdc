# Circuit Class

The [circuitmcp/circuit.py](mdc:circuitmcp/circuit.py) file implements the Circuit class, which is the core data model for circuit simulation.

## Key Functionalities:
- **Component Management**: Adding, removing, and updating circuit components
- **Simulation**: Creating PySpice circuits and running simulations (DC, AC, transient)
- **Visualization**: Generating schematic drawings using SchemDraw
- **Versioning**: Tracking circuit history and allowing retrieval of previous versions

## Component Types:
- Resistors (R), Capacitors (C), Inductors (L)
- Voltage Sources (V), Current Sources (I)
- Diodes (D), Transistors (Q, M)
- Universal Verification Xcomponents (UVX) for complex devices like op-amps

## Usage:
The Circuit class is used by the MCP server in [circuitmcp/mcp_server.py](mdc:circuitmcp/mcp_server.py) to implement the circuit simulation capabilities exposed through the MCP API.
