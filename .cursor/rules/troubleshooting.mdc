# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues:

### NGSpice Library Not Found
```
cannot load library 'libngspice.dylib'
```

**Solution**: 
1. Install NGSpice using your package manager:
   - macOS: `brew install ngspice`
   - Ubuntu: `apt-get install ngspice`
   - Windows: Download from the NGSpice website
2. Make sure the library is in your system's library path

### Simulation Errors
If you encounter errors during simulation, check:
1. Component connections (all nodes must be properly connected)
2. Component values (must be valid for the component type)
3. Analysis parameters (must match the expected format)

### Schematic Generation
If schematic generation works but looks incorrect:
1. Check component order (affects layout)
2. Verify node connections
3. The schematics directory must exist

## Testing:
- [circuitmcp/test_mcp.py](mdc:circuitmcp/test_mcp.py) can be used to verify server functionality
- Run with `python circuitmcp/test_mcp.py`
